Assignment 12: Deploy and Run the Project in AWS Without Using the Port
Step 1: Create an EC2 Instance
- Launch a new EC2 instance as you did in Assignment 11. Use the same configuration (for example, using an Ubuntu AMI).

Step 2: Connect to the Instance
- Connect to your EC2 instance via your preferred SSH client (such as Bitvise SSH Client or the terminal).
- For example, if using SSH:
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@<EC2-IP-address>


Step 3: Modify the Nginx Configuration for the Reverse Proxy
- Change to the Nginx configuration directory and prepare to edit the default website configuration:
- Navigate to the directory:
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
ls
- Change the permissions of the default configuration file so you can edit it:
sudo chmod 777 default
- Open the default file in a text editor (using nano for example):
nano default
- Locate (or create) the location / { ... } block within the server configuration. Replace or add the following code to proxy incoming HTTP requests to your locally running project on port 4000:
location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:4000;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
}


- Save the changes in nano by pressing Ctrl+O, then Enter, and exit with Ctrl+X.
- (Optional but recommended) Reload the Nginx configuration to apply the changes:
sudo systemctl reload nginx


Step 4: Test the Deployment
- Open an incognito window in your web browser and paste your EC2 instanceâ€™s public URL (or public IP address). Since Nginx now proxies incoming traffic from port 80 to port 4000 internally, you should see your project without having to include :4000 in the URL.
